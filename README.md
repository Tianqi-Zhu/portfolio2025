# Tianqi Zhu
I am a master student in MComp(AI) at NUS. I am interested in making AI algorithms and systems human-entered, efficient, robust, and generalisable. I am open to PhD/RA/internship/job positions.

## Past projects

### Computer vision intern @ [Polybee](https://polybee.co/)
- Developed QR code detection pipeline leveraging Detectron2 and OpenCV that achieved 90% accuracy in the wild with occlusion, movion blur, and uneven lighting.
- Proposed using knowledge based and graphical models to further improve the pipeline.

### Software member at [team Bumblebee](https://bumblebee.sg/)
- Contributed in vision and mission planning for BBAUV and BBASV.

### Image to image translation via Wasserstein Gradient flow 
- Reviewed state-of-the-art generative modeling methods like diffusion models, EBM, GAN etc, and their application to sim2real transfer for robot learning.
- Developed and evaluated image-to-image translation methods via Wasserstein Gradient Flow with specifically trained or robust classifier density ratio estimator.
