# Tianqi Zhu
I am a master student in MComp(AI) at NUS. I am interested in making AI algorithms and systems human-entered, efficient, robust, and generalisable. I am open to PhD/RA/internship/job positions.

## Past projects

### Research assistant @ [IPAL](https://ipal.cnrs.fr/) [DroneBuddy](https://ahlab.org/project/dronebuddy/)
- Designed user study on LLM for blind drone interaction in a team of three. 
- Reviewed literature for customizable robot navigation systems for blind guidance, and identified key gaps in user interaction design. 

### Computer vision intern @ [Polybee](https://polybee.co/)
- Developed QR code detection pipeline leveraging Detectron2 and OpenCV that achieved 90% accuracy in the wild with occlusion, movion blur, and uneven lighting.
- Proposed using knowledge base and graphical models to further improve the pipeline.

### Software member @ [NUS Team Bumblebee](https://bumblebee.sg/)
- Contributed in vision and mission planning for BBAUV and BBASV.

### Image to image translation via Wasserstein gradient flow @ [CLeAR Lab NUS](https://clear-nus.github.io/)
- Reviewed state-of-the-art generative modeling methods like diffusion models, EBM, GAN etc, and their application to sim2real transfer for robot learning.
- Developed and evaluated image-to-image translation methods via Wasserstein Gradient Flow with specifically trained or robust classifier density ratio estimator.

### Game [Fractalia](https://vixra.org/abs/2512.0082)
- Explore in 3d Fractal world and enjoy the beauty of recursion.
- Defeat bugs and collect scared text on history of mathematics.


## Volunteering

### Volunteer mentor at [CCSGP](https://www.ccsgp.comp.nus.edu.sg/)
- Mentored kids programming class.

### Technical consulting associate at [Bridges for Enterprise Singapore](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/volunteers/chapters/singapore)
- Helped [Sonvisage](https://sonvisage.com/about), an African healthcare IoT startup, write some scripts.
